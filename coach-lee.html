              <h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
              <h5>Q: Do i need a coach?</h5>
              <p>A: Whether it is top athletes or business company CEOs, they all need coaches by their side to give feedback and suggestions through observation. So no matter who you are, you should try to find a professional coach.</p>
              <h5>Q: Do you provide any other interview-related coaching? </h5>
              <p>A: Currently, we offer Interview Questions Discussion, Mock Interview, and Algorithm Discussion. If you need other assistance, please contact contact@osjobs.net.</p>
              <h5>Q: Can I get a refund on unused pack?</h5>
              <p>A: Yes, but the packs that have been used will be deducted at the original price. For example, if you purchased the Prepare for Interview (4-pack) and only took two classes and need a refund, the refund amount would be the amount you paid ($850) minus the cost of two classes ($550), which equals $300.</p>
